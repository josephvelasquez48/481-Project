## Project Title: Spam Email Classifier

Project Description:
This project is an email classifier that will utilize trained ML models to predict if an email is considered spam or not spam. It will be trained on a dataset that will be preprocessed prior to training. The model will be trained using the Naive Bayes algorithm approach.
